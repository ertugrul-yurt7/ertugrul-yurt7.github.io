Personal portfolio site for CMPT-276 mini-project and for future personal use.
As a first project that I have done in GITHUB, it was a bit challenging to complete it.
Through the completion of the project I have learned how to use Github properly,
I learned how to integrate html, css, and JavaScript files together.

# License Choice
I chose the MIT license because itâ€™s a popular, permissive license that can let anyone use 
and share my code as long as they credit me. Also it is the only license I am aware of.
